                                            Orders are typically processed within 2–3 business days. Once your order
                                            has shipped, delivery typically takes 3–7 business days, depending on
                                            your location. You will receive a shipping confirmation email with
                                            tracking details once your order has been dispatched. We recommend
                                            inspecting your order upon delivery. If you receive a damaged,
                                            defective, or incorrect item, please contact us right away so we can
